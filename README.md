Responsive Design Project (Anarchist Folk Band Website)


This is a short design project to flex my skills at adaptive design for various sized screens.

I feel like the end result is rather inelegant, but I got a bit stuck with a few formatting things so I kind of gave up when I got close to what I wanted.

Is there any way I could have made my life easier and still gotten a similar result?
